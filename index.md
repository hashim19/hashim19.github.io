I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan, Dearborn. I am working with [Dr. Hafiz Malik](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~hafiz/ "Dr. Hafiz Malik"){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at [the Information Systems, Security and Forensics Lab](https://issf.umd.umich.edu/ "the Information Systems, Security and Forensics Lab"){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. My research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Machine Learning and Media Forensics. Nowadays, I am working towards fake audio generation and detection. These fake audios include replayed audios and computer generated audios like deep fakes. 

In 2016, I completed my Undergraduate degree in mechatronics and Control Engineering from University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. After that I worked as a Research Assistant at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). In 2019, I completed my Masters from LUMS in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Abubakr Muhammad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abubakr-muhammad-604a4927/?originalSubdomain=pk "Dr. Abubakr Muhammad"){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. My thesis was focused on Context Aware Driver Performance Analysis using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We tested the proposed framework on tailgating examples from long haul trucks and identified good and bad driving behaviors. In 2019, I went on a fully funded internship program to Fukuoka, Japan where I worked at [AIBOD](https://www.aibod.com/ "AIBOD"){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and developed the backend for an inventory classification system using Resnet features and nearest Neighbors (KNN).

I worked as an AI engineer at Innowi from Dec 2019 to Dec 2020. I worked on developing an indoor localization algorithm for a hand-held device using Kalman Filter. In 2021, I became a PhD student at the University of Michigan.
